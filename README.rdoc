== Limitation

Current benchmark code run a for loop to create / destroy votes sequently.
It does not utilize database 100%.

Results are validated after each vote / unvote and take some time too.

== Solutions

* ActiveRecordSolution: Use votes table, store counters (votes_counts, up_votes_count, down_votes_count) and votes_point in posts
* NaiveMongoidSolution: Equivalent to ActiveRecordSolution (use votes collection ...)
* VoteableMongoidSolution: Use https://github.com/vinova/voteable_mongo gem
* VoteableMongoMapperSolution: Use https://github.com/vinova/voteable_mongo gem

== Benchmark Results

=== Environment

  Linode 768MB RAM
  Ubuntu 10.04 Server 32-bit
  MySQL 5.1.41 Community Server
  MongoDB 1.8.1
  Ruby 1.9.2p180

=== Without additional indexing

  ./run.rb active_record skip_additional_indexes
  ./run.rb naive_mongoid skip_additional_indexes
  ./run.rb voteable_mongoid skip_additional_indexes
  ./run.rb voteable_mongo_mapper skip_additional_indexes

Note: skip_additional_indexes mean skip creating indexes that don't speed up voting and unvoting processes (e.g. counters, votes_point)
